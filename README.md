# Disclaimer
I don't own **gaminganywhere** source code. I improved it to have adaptive bandwidth streaming. Adaptive here is accomplished by changing media encoding parameter based on fuzzy logic.

_I should have used **fork** instead, but it pains to have it start all over again, sorry :worried:_
