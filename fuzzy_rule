input variable: loss, delay, jitter.
output variable: quality.

loss {low, high} [0% 100%] (pkts_loss/pkts_sent)
delay {low, high} [1ms 1000ms]
jitter {low, high} []

quality {very low, low, medium, high, very high}
quality=[crf, fps, bitrate, vbv]

LOW<--------------->HIGH
crf={50,40,30,20,10}
bitrate={300,500,1000,2000,3000}
vbv={125,325,425,525,625}

[FUZZY CRF]
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then CRF is VERY HIGH
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is HIGH then CRF is HIGH
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then CRF is MEDIUM
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is LOW then CRF is LOW
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is HIGH then CRF is VERY LOW

[FUZZY BITRATE]
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then BITRATE is VERY HIGH
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is HIGH then BITRATE is HIGH
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then BITRATE is MEDIUM
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is LOW then BITRATE is LOW
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is HIGH then BITRATE is VERY LOW

[FUZZY VBV]
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then VBV is VERY HIGH
if LOSS is LOW and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is HIGH then VBV is HIGH
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is LOW and JITTER is LOW then VBV is MEDIUM
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is LOW then VBV is LOW
if LOSS is HIGH and DELAY is HIGH and JITTER is HIGH then VBV is VERY LOW
